# This workflow checks the `dist/` directory for uncommitted changes by comparing it with a fresh build from `src/`.
# `dist/index.js` is a crucial file in GitHub Actions.
# When an action is referenced using `uses:` in a workflow, `dist/index.js` serves as the entry point.
# In our project, this file is generated through a build process from `src/*.ts` source files.
# To maintain consistency, we must ensure that the checked-in `dist/index.js` is always up to date with the source files.
# This workflow prevents cases where source files are modified but `dist/index.js` is not regenerated.
